ParkenDD shows you the current parking situation of various European cities, including Dresden, Ingolstadt and Zurich. Depending on the available data, you can see the current number of available public parking spots as well as their locations. For several parking spots, there is also some experimental forecast available. 

Features of this app:

- see the current parking situation of various European cities
- get details for available parking spots
- view the parking spots on a map
- helpful Cortana integration (e.g. ask "ParkenDD, where can I park in Dresden?" or "ParkenDD, show me details for the Centrum Galerie in Dresden!")

If your city is missing, feel free to support us by integrating open data into our GitHub project [ParkAPI](https://github.com/offenesdresden/ParkAPI). 

ParkenDD also exists for **Android** and **iOS**, have a look at the [project page](http://parkendd.de) if you're interested.

Pull requests are very welcome and if you'd like to have the app in your own language, you can easily help translating [the app itself](https://poeditor.com/projects/view?id=40160) and [the Cortana voice commands](https://poeditor.com/projects/view?id=40725).
